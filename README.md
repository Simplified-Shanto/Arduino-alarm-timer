# Arduino-alarm-timer
This repository contains code for an arduino based alarm timer. 

With this project, you can make an alarm timer using arduino. The main hardwares required are an Arduino board (Arduino uno used for this particular code) and an lcd display. You'll set a duration of time (say 10 minutes) and press the start button. Then it will start counting time and display it on the display. When the set time is up, it will start beeping until the "Rest Button" is pressed.
